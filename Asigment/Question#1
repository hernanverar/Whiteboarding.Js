Question #1: Turning Strings to URLs
URLs cannot have spaces. Instead, all spaces in a string are replaced with %20. Write an algorithm that replaces all spaces in a string with %20.

You may not use the replace() method or regular expressions to solve this problem. Solve the problem with and without recursion.

Example
Input: "Jasmine Ann Jones"

Output: "Jasmine%20Ann%20Jones"

Answer # 1 In Javascript 

function replaceSpaces (inputString) {
  let result = "";

  for (let i = 0; i < inputString.length; i++) {
    if (stringRecursive [i] === " ") {
      result += "20%";
    }
    else {
      result += inputString[i];
    }
  }

  return result;
  
}
const inputString = "Jasmine Ann Jones";
const OutputString = replaceSpaces (inputString)
